# interactive-svg-concept

With Adobe Illustrator, each element can be uniquely named, this naming convention is carried through into an exported SVG. 

Taking this SVG we know what the elements are called so we can traverse them as we would other DOM elements, add event listeners and do stuff.

This simple demo takes an exported SVG code and adds click event listeners to the button elements to load the related content into a popup container
